# Functional-Programming-Problems-SML-

A file with prompts and solutions to dozens of SML homework assignments, and a file with prewritten tests to those problems.

The reason that I am including these files on my GitHub is to demonstrate my ability to quickly learn and work with other languages/paradigms to potential employers.

To run these:

-install smlnj

-Add the path (macOS): export PATH="/usr/local/smlnj/bin/:${PATH}"

in terminal type: sml SML_Tester.sml

The function that I am most proud of is binarySearch.
